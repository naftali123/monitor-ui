More detailed: 
Provides a user-friendly dashboard page that displays real-time information on the activity of multiple APIs and services. The dashboard page is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly access the information they need to monitor the health of their APIs and services.

The dashboard page includes a summary view that provides a quick overview of the status of each API or service, including whether it is currently up or down, the response time, and any error codes that were encountered during the last request. Users can click on each API or service to drill down into more detailed information, such as the number of requests made, the average response time, and the status of each individual endpoint.

The dashboard uses simple HTTP requests via a monitor server to track the activity of each API and service. The monitor server periodically sends requests to each API or service and records the response time, status code, and any error messages that are returned. This information is then used to update the dashboard page in real-time, allowing users to quickly identify any issues and take action as needed.

The dashboard also provides alerts and notifications to help users stay on top of any issues with their APIs and services. Users can set up custom alerts based on specific criteria, such as a certain error code being returned or the response time exceeding a certain threshold. When an alert is triggered, users can receive notifications via email, SMS, or push notification, depending on their preferences.
